INTRODUCTION 
------------

Written by Hamish Sanderson of appscript fame, a sophisticated module loading application for AppleScript. Also, a collection of some 35 high powered modules to go with it. It's an immense shame that no one seems to be bright enough to use it. On the other hand, I guess once you know what you're doing, you stop using AppleScript. I know I did.

Note about the rest of this file: I'm just kidding, I'm not really going to do any of that stuff.

INSTALLATION 
------------

To be announced. There are some ISSUES.

ISSUES 
------

1. Since I converted all the scripts to plain text so they could usefully be under source control, I'll either need to add a build step or alter the Loader to handle that.
2. I noticed some bonkers characters in the source files that need to be cleaned up. Not sure the source of the problem off hand.

TODO 
----

1. Port more modules from other languages?
2. Add modules to bake in recipes for popular scriptable applications?
3. Start an AppleScript FAQ?
4. Resolve the TODOs sprinkled in the code.
5. Not really a Loader TODO, but perhaps add repo to unit test the interface of scriptable applications.
6. There should be simple examples of each member.
7. Clippings insertion script?
8. There should be an apologia for each class and member.
