INTRODUCTION 
------------

Written by Hamish Sanderson of appscript fame, a sophisticated module loading application for AppleScript. Also, a collection of some 35 high powered modules to go with it. It's an immense shame that no one seems to be bright enough to use it. On the other hand, I guess once you know what you're doing, you stop using AppleScript. I know I did.

Just for fun, perhaps I'll revisit my old stomping grounds and add a module or two.

INSTALLATION 
------------

To be announced.

ISSUES 
------

Yes.

TODO 
----

We'll see.
